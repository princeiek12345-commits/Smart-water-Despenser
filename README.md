# Smart-water-Despenser
A simple Arduino-based smart water dispenser for automatic water flow control.
This project is designed to reduce manual effort in controlling water flow and ensure efficient usage.  


## ✨ Features  
- Automatic control of water flow  
- Prevents water wastage  
- Easy to set up and operate  
- Beginner-friendly Arduino project  

---

## 🛠️ Components Used  
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)  
- Water pump  
- Relay module  
- Jumper wires  
- Power supply  
- Breadboard / basic circuit setup  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The Arduino is programmed to control the water pump.  
2. When powered, the pump is activated to dispense water.  
3. The relay acts as a switch between the Arduino and the pump.  
4. This setup allows safe and automated water dispensing.
